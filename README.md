gmail-brute-forcer
==================

THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE DUE TO GMAIL TIGHTENING SECURITY UP.

A brute forcer for gmail only. Command line utility only. 

To use: argv0 = program name | argv1 = gmail user name | argv2 = password list

EXAMPLE: bash program_name gmail_username password_list.lst
